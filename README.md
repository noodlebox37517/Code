These files are mostly from personal projects and time at uni, thusly the commenting is not what i would call upto a group standard.

2022: added some old projects as zips that I will probably never pick up again (dragonrun and a game jam from 2019) they should run but i believe may have bugs eventually.

also added a code snippets folder which i will try and add interesting/complex code I create.
